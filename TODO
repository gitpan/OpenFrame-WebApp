=======================
 OpenFrame-WebApp Todo
=======================

1. Write more Segments

Loaders of all sorts.  Including:
	Session::UrlLoader
	Session::QueryLoader

More Decliners.


3. Tests library

Move repeated test code into t/lib.


4. Configuration

Use Pipeline::Config for example app?  And other examples?  This would
make the purpose & usage of each segment more clear.


5. Localization hooks?

Shoud we stick something in the pipe to do localization for everything?  Or
should each class know how to localize whatever it needs to?

(moved down in priority: maybe all localization can be done in templates?)

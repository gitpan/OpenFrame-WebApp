=======================
 OpenFrame-WebApp Todo
=======================

1. Write more Segments

Loaders of all sorts:
	Session::UrlLoader
	Session::QueryLoader

	User::SessionLoader ?


2. Configuration

Use Pipeline::Config?


3. Figure out how to do Localization

Shoud we stick something in the pipe to do localization for everything?  Or
should each class know how to localize whatever it needs to?

(moved down in priority: maybe all localization can be done in templates?)


4. Tests library

Starting to repeat a lot of code in tests.  Should start using t/lib


5. Registered sub-classes

Stick all known sub-classes in the class itself... this way the factory classes
can do an eval to load them if there's no constructor available.

 Design Notes
==============

1. Errors

Exceptions thrown via the Error module will double as error flags that can
be localized.  No Errors should be thown in the Pipeline Segments -- this is
the level where they should be caught and dealt with.


2. Wrappers & Factories

Wrappers have been used wherever a large number of implementation options
are available (ie: template systems, sessions, etc).

Though not necessary, Factory classes can help protect the programmer from
changes in design, and will hopefully lead to higher code re-use.
